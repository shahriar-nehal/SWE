      # Removed 'npm install' because this manual test doesn't rely on Jest/npm dependencies
      # If you later decide to run ESLint/Stylelint, you would need npm install.

        run: node test_sketch.js
        # If node test_sketch.js exits with a non-zero code (due to a failed assert),
        # this step will fail, and the GitHub Action workflow will show as failed.
